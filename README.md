# Souq Peripheral V1

This repository contains all the peripheral smart contract source code for Souq Protocol Components. The repository uses Hardhat as development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

# What is Souq?

Souq.finance is building an Automated Market Maker (AMM) as one its products for the purpose of trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The purpose of this AMM is to introduce a superior, incentive-aligned fee structure for project ecosystems, improve market efficiency and pricing dynamics, and enable instant liquidity in NFT markets.
This repository contains all the peripheral components codebase of the AMM.

## Getting Started

### Extra Documentation and Tutorials
The project is run as a Hardhat-based project, with sensible defaults.

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [Hardhat Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the
- [Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.

### Sensible Defaults

This repository comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .commitlintrc.yml
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhintignore
├── .solhint.json
├── .yarnrc.yml
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### GitHub Actions

This repository comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must use your `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` and your `MNEMONIC` as GitHub secrets.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Conventional Commits

This repository enforces the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for git commit
messages. This is a lightweight convention that creates an explicit commit history, which makes it easier to write
automated tools on top of.

### Git Hooks

This repository uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run automated checks on commit messages, and
[Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to automatically format the code with Prettier when making a git
commit.

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an
environment variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use
this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

To test specific script:

```sh
$ npx hardhat test test/<Sub_Folder>/<File_Name>.spec.ts
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy --welcome "Hello, welcome"
```
Goerli Testnet

```sh
$ npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Tips

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.
